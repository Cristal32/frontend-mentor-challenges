## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I learned more about responsive design and the use of media queries. As well as adopting the mobile-first workflow, where we start designing for mobile sizes first, before expanding to larger screens using `@media` with a minimum width that specifies styling towards screens that are larger than that width:

```
@media only screen and (min-width: 431px) {
    .card {
       //...
       width: 384px;
    }
}
```
