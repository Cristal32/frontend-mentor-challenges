## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned a bit more about grid layout, as well as the concept of box sizing.

```css
.img-container {
    /*...*/
    box-sizing: border-box;
    /*...*/
  }
```

Border box allowed my image container to take its set width instead of overflowing outside of the main container.
